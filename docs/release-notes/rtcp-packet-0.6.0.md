# rtcp-packet 0.6.0

_Released 2026-10-16._

**Epoch-forced major-class release.** Epoch-forced release. Own change since `rtcp-packet-v0.5.0`: fixes. Its public API does not change in a way that needs source migration; it ships because a workspace sibling it depends on moves to a new caret epoch (see below), and the workspace's epoch-purity rule forbids publishing a crate that still requires the old epoch next to the new one.

## Why this version

- **Proposed version:** 0.5.0 -> **0.6.0** (major-class: 0.x minor-epoch bump).
- **Own API/behaviour change class:** patch (fixes).
- **cargo-semver-checks vs live 0.5.0 (all features):** none flagged. (Lint-based: it misses type changes of existing fields/arguments, so the CHANGELOG BREAKING list is the primary evidence.)
- **Epoch cascade:** epoch cascade from broadcast-common. Siblings it depends on that move epoch in this wave: broadcast-common.
- **Caret epoch:** 0.5 -> 0.6; every workspace dependent must move with it.

## Dependency changes

```toml
-broadcast-common = "9.4"
+broadcast-common = "10.0"
```

## Breaking changes and migration

No source-level migration is required beyond bumping the version requirement and, if the crate exposes `broadcast-common` types in its API, moving to `broadcast-common` 10 in the same dependency graph.

## What changed (from CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`)

#### Documentation
- README restructured: what the crate does and does not do, a standards-supported table (edition, scope, status), feature-flag table, a doctested quick start and related crates; crate-root docs now render the README (or are kept in step with it).

#### Changed (BREAKING: epoch — requires broadcast-common 10)
- Builds against new caret epochs of workspace siblings (`broadcast-common` 9 -> 10). A caret-epoch change is major-class for this crate under the epoch-purity rule (`docs/RELEASE-AUDIT.md` §2), whatever its own API diff. `Serialize::to_bytes` was removed (use `try_to_bytes`); consumers must resolve a single `broadcast-common` 10.

#### Fixed

- **`ReportBlock::cumulative_lost` outside the 24-bit signed range is rejected (#1129).** It was masked with `& 0x00FF_FFFF`, so `0x80_0000` serialized as a different loss count; `serialize_into` now returns `Error::InvalidValue`.

#### Fixed
- SDES item text and BYE reason are UTF-8 validated before the `String` is allocated, so a long invalid text field no longer costs a copy of itself (#1123/RTCP-O1). `test-alloc` added as a dev-dependency for the allocation-count test.
